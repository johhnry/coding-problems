# Problem 9 (medium)

## Task

Implement a job scheduler which takes in a function `f` and an integer `n`, and calls `f` after `n` milliseconds.

Note: since we are doing this in JavaScript, you must use Promises

## Function signature

Implement the following function in `src/problems/problem-9/problem-9.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * Calls f after n milliseconds
 * @param f the function to call
 * @param n number of milliseconds
 */
function scheduleJob(f, n) {
  // Your code here
}
```

### Run the tests

To check if your solution is right, run the tests:

```shell
$ npm run test:problem 9
```
