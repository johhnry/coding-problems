# Problem 12 (hard)

## Task

Given an integer `k` and a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring that contains at most `k` distinct characters.

For example, given `s = "abcba"` and `k = 2`, the longest substring with `k` distinct characters is `"bcb"` so the result is `3`.

## Function signature

Implement the following function in `src/problems/problem-12/problem-12.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the length of the longest substring that contains at most k distinct characters
 * @param s input string
 * @param k maximum number of different letters
 */
function lengthOfTheLongestSubstringThatContainsAtMost(s, k) {
  // Your code here
}
```

### Run the tests

To check if your solution is right, run the tests:

```shell
$ npm run test:problem 12
```
