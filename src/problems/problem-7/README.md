# Problem 7 (easy)

## Task

A unival tree (which stands for "universal value") is a tree where all nodes under it have the same value.

Given the root to a binary tree, count the number of unival subtrees.

For example, the following tree has 5 unival subtrees:

```

```

## Function signature

Implement the following function in `src/problems/problem-7/problem-7.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * Counts the number of unival subtrees given a tree
 * @param root the tree root node
 */
function countUnivalSubtrees(root) {
  // Your code here
}
```

Note: you might need to create another helper function for this problem

### Run the tests

To check if your solution is right, run the tests:

```shell
$ npm run test:problem 7
```
