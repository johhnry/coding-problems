# Problem 18 (easy)

## Task

Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.

For example, given `[(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)]`, you should return `2`.

## Function signature

Implement the following function in `src/problems/problem-18/problem-18.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * Finds the minimum number of rooms required
 * @param intervals array of intervals (two element lists)
 */
function minimumNumberOfRoomsRequired(intervals) {
  // Your code here
}
```

### Run the tests

To check if your solution is right, run the tests:

```shell
$ npm run test:problem 18
```
