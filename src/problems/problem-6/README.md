# Problem 6 (medium)

## Task

Given the mapping `a = 1, b = 2, ... z = 26`, and an encoded message, count the number of ways it can be decoded.

For example, the message `'111'` would give `3`, since it could be decoded as `'aaa'`, `'ka'`, and `'ak'`.

You can assume that the messages are decodable. For example, `'001'` is not allowed.

## Function signature

Implement the following function in `src/problems/problem-6/problem-6.js`:

```javascript
/**
 * Counts the number of ways the message can be decoded
 * @param message
 */
function numberOfWaysItCanBeDecoded(message) {
  // Your code here
}
```

### Run the tests

To check if your solution is right, run the tests:

```shell
$ npm run test:problem 6
```
